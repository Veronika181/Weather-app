**Weather app**
On this project, I've developed a weather application designed to provide current weather information for any city worldwide. Leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app fetches real-time meteorological data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays key weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Usage:
Enter the desired city name in the search field.
Click the search button to retrieve weather data.
The application will display the current weather information, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
